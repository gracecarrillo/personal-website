üìä I'm a Logistics Engineer turned Data Scientist with 5+ years of Data Analysis experience. I've been doing data analysis since working as a Programmes' Liaison at an urban development government agency where I learned the power of storytelling with stats. 

üéì I hold an M.Sc. in Urban & Public Policy, where I used quantitative research methods with STATA. I also did 3 years of transportation research at PhD level with R.

üë©‚Äçüè´ I teach Advanced Statistics, Python & HTML programming, Python & R for Data Science, engineering and maths at the [University of Glasgow's Glasgow International College](https://www.kaplanpathways.com/colleges/glasgow-international-college/). 

üíª I'm a Data Science Consultant at [Candidates.ai](http://candidates.ai/), a stealth mode New York based start-up where I've worked on end-to-end machine learning and deep learning projects using highly customised data scraping scripts, NLP cleaning pipelines, feature engineering & predictive modelling.

üìö I do LiveProjects implementations & reviews of end-to-end Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects with [Manning Publications](https://liveproject.manning.com.). 

üí∞ I'm a Co-founder & COO at an early venture FinTech start-up based in Amsterdam. We are using the latest in machine learning and deep learning technologies to create our proof of concept for a customer-facing AI solution to bias in the active asset management industry.


üí¨ I'd love to know about your project. [Let's chat.](https://calendly.com/gracecarrillo/30-minute-meeting)
